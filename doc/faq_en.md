## Submitted a code to AtCoder, but the result is not reflected
When immediately after the contest ends, we're crawling through submissions during the contest, so there may be a slight delay in the reflection.
Otherwise, normally it takes about 5 minutes. If it doesn't, please let us know, as there may be a system problem.

## I changed my user name on AtCoder and it's all gone
AtCoder Problems constantly recrawls the AtCoder submissions and they will be reflected in Atcoder Problems if an update is detected.
With the growth of AtCoder, the number of submissions has exploded, so it will take a few days to a few weeks to recrawl all the submissions.
Please be patient.

## Will submissions made during the contest be reflected?
It will be reflected.
After the contest ends, they will be stored in the database through detecting the contest which just ended, crawling all the submissions made during the contest, checking consistency etc.
It may take a few hours to complete the process, so please be patient.

## I don't know how to read the symbol â—’ representing a difficulty value
This is a tribute to TopCoder that was popular when the developers of this service were in college.
The more full the circle is, the more difficult the problem is estimated to be.
Mouse over or click on it to see the specific value.

## What are the difficulty values?
The value of the rate such that 50% of people with the rate can solve the problem
It is estimated statistically based on the contest results.
Roughly speaking, a problem with X color means "a problem that half of the people in X color can solve", but not means "a problem that the people in X color can solve".
