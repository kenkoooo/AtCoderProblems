# Frequently Asked Questions

## The page is blank / empty.

Please update your browser to the latest version.
Sometimes it is not the latest version even if you think it is.
If it really is the latest version and the site does not work, please let us know because it is a bug.

## My submission on AtCoder is not reflected in the site.

There may be a slight delay immediately after a contest ends because we are crawling submissions during the contest.
Otherwise, it takes about 5 minutes for us to crawl your submission.  
If it takes longer, please let us know as there may be a problem with the system.

## I changed my username on AtCoder and all submissions are gone.

AtCoder Problems constantly recrawls all the AtCoder submissions and they will be reflected in AtCoder Problems if they are updated.
With the growth of AtCoder, the number of submissions has exploded, so it takes a few days to a few weeks to recrawl all the submissions.
Please be patient.

## Will submissions made during contests be reflected?

It will be reflected.
When we detect that a contest ends, all the submissions made during the contest will be crawled. The submissions will be inserted into the database after an integrity check is performed.
It may take a few hours until the process is completed, so please be patient.

## I don't know how to read the symbol â—’ representing a difficulty value.

This is a tribute to TopCoder, which was popular when the developers of this service were in college.
The more filled the circle is, the more difficult the problem is estimated to be.
Move the mouse pointer over it or click it to see the actual difficulty value.

## What are the difficulty values?

The difficulty value is the rating that 50% of people with the rating can solve the problem.
It is estimated statistically based on the contest results.
Roughly speaking, a problem with color X means that "a problem that half of the people with color X can solve", not "a problem that people with color X can solve".

## What is Current Streak / Longest Streak?

Current Streak is the number of consecutive days on which you solve a new problem that you have not solved before.
Longest Streak is the maximum value of Current Streak.
